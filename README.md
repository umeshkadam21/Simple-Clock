# ⏰ Simple Clock in C++

This is a simple Clock project built using C++, which displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds format.
It continuously updates the time in real-time using basic C++ concepts like loops, functions, and time handling from the standard library.

⚙️ Features

- Displays current system time 🕒
- Updates every second ⏱️

- Easy to understand and beginner-friendly 💡

- Uses standard C++ libraries only — no external dependencies 📦

🧠 Concepts Used

- time.h / <chrono> for fetching and handling system time

- iostream for displaying output

- sleep_for() for delay and smooth time refresh

- Loops and functions for structure and readability

🧩 How It Works

- The program fetches the current time from your system.
